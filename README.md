Group API Project - Project Assessment

Your assignment is to build a .NET Framework API Web Application using n-tier architecture covering a topic of your group's choosing.

This API should include at least one custom table per member of your group with a minimum of three tables (excluding the given user table), at least one of the tables should implement Foreign Key relationship between said tables.

Initial setup should include working together as a team to work through the planning stage. This stage should include:

A layout of what the database tables should look like and how they should interact (You might consider using a tool like dbdiagram.io (Links to an external site.))
You will need to review your idea and whiteboard this out with an instructor
Fill out the planning document attached to the project module
Break out the work load into consumable chunks, from your immediate TODOs to your long term stretch goals
Delegating a table to each team member who will be responsible for full CRUD in that table.
 

Requirements:
Come up with an idea for an application that will utilize at least one custom data table for each member of your group with a minimum of three tables
Including at least one Foreign Key relationship
Create a wireframe of the application and review it with an instructor
Build out an n-tier structured API (think ElevenNote) with the following tiers
Data: This layer houses your classes that relate to the DB (POCOs, Identity, etc)
Models: This layer houses the reusable models for the rest of the layers
Services: This layer is where you will have most of your heavy backend logic
Web API: This is where the controllers and API endpoints will be
Link to repository site on your deployed Portfolio
Repository has a README.md (Links to an external site.) associated with the project

Use Visual Studio to create classes and controllers
Use GitHub to push, pull, and merge data amongst the team members
Use Agile practices to divy, point, and track duties as well as User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Sprint plans
Use Trello to track above-mentioned Agile practices
The goal of our app is to allow users to create their own character. The user will be able to choose a name for their character, as well as choose physical attributes. If they so choose, they can also allow the app to randomly create a character for them. We also hope to allow the user to export their character for outside uses.

Group API Project - Individual Assessment

Overview:
Upon completion of your group assignment take some time to reflect on the experience of the project. What knowledge have you gained and what skillsets have you sharpened. Write a brief summary (Two (2) Paragraphs) describe this experience. It should include your individual contributions, your experience with GitHub and Team Git, the skills you have developed as part of a developer team, and of course personal growth.

This assignment will also act as an evaluation of your individual contribution to the project. Assessing your individual endpoints/functionality, team contribution, professionalism, and drive.

Group API Project - Presentation

It is now time to present your team project! As a team you will present your project. After each presentation, there will be time for some Q and A in regard to your projects. For your presentation, we would like to see you present yourself in a professional manner and to dress nicely (business or business casual). Remember to be proud of all of the work you have done! The presentation will allow the team as a whole to discuss the project, as well as each individual sharing the parts of the project they worked on specifically. Take this time to talk about your challenges and successes, as you will be assessed on the work you have done as well as how you interacted with your team.
